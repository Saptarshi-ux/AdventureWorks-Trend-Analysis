**AdventureWorks Trend Analysis Report**

From January 2015 through mid-2016, AdventureWorks’ sales and profits followed a modest upward trajectory, with monthly revenues hovering around ₹500 K and profits near ₹150 K. In July 2016, two new product lines—**Clothing** and **Accessories**—were launched. Immediately thereafter, total sales accelerated from ₹600 K to over ₹1.8 M by early 2017, and profits surged from ₹200 K to nearly ₹800 K, outpacing the prior three-month moving average and validating the strategic expansion.

Category-level returns remained low and stable pre-July, with the **Bikes** segment dominating return volumes. Post-launch, **Accessories** and **Clothing** exhibited a gradual rise in return counts—peaking at roughly 120 units—but still represent under 10% of total returns, indicating healthy product acceptance alongside strong revenue gains.

In summary, the mid-2016 introduction of Clothing and Accessories markedly boosted AdventureWorks’ top- and bottom-line growth, while return rates across all categories remain within acceptable limits. These trends underscore the success of product diversification and point to sustained profitability as the company continues to refine its offering.
